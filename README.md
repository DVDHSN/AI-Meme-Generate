    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and add your Google API Key like this:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    Start the Streamlit server.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser should automatically open to the application's URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
